## Tractor Backend

This repository is a component of the final project of switching theory and is based on the development of a backend consisting of 2 types of initialization, server type initialization and proteus type initialization.

## Requirements

- Have installed NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/es/)
- Clone this repository
- Run `npm i` command in the generated folder

## Working with Proteus

- Download the files from the following repository (https://github.com/Shiroke-013/Final-Conmutacion)
- Open the INO file and the Proteus project
- Compile the INO code and load the binary into the Arduino Mega
- Having the COM1 and COM2 ports virtualized, you can use VirtualSerialPort (https://www.virtual-serial-port.org/es/)
- Run the file `proteus.sh`

## Working with the Server

- Run `server.sh`
- Check operation with the port *:9000
